        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This copycat recipe comes pretty close to the real deal. Serve each slider with American cheese, dill pickle slices, and DÃ¼sseldorf mustard.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds ground chuck</li>
            <li>1/3 cup plain bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>24 small square dinner rolls</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine ground chuck, bread crumbs, egg, onion soup mix, water, and black pepper in a bowl; press into a 10x15-inch jelly roll pan. Prick holes through the chuck mixture for ventilation while cooking.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Drain excess grease.</li>
            <li>Cut chuck mixture into squares the size of the rolls. Place 1 chuck patty in each roll.</li>
        </ol>
